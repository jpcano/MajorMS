# MajorMS

Major Mnemonic System (MajorMS), is a tool that converts numbers into consonants, then into words by adding vowels.

It is used to help in memorizing numbers following  major system (also called the phonetic number system, phonetic mnemonic system, or HÃ©rigone's mnemonic system). The system works on the principle that images can be remembered more easily than numbers.
