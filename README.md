# MajorMS

![screenshot](screenshot.png)

Major Mnemonic System (MajorMS), is a tool that converts numbers into words.

It is based on the [Major System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic_major_system) (also called the phonetic number system, phonetic mnemonic system, or HÃ©rigone's mnemonic system). The system works on the principle that images visualized from words can be remembered more easily than raw numbers.
